 In  addition,  demand  has  recently  increased  for  chloroquine  and  hydroxychloroquine. These medications  are  routinely  used  for  treatment  of  lupus,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  and  other  chronic  medical conditions. Increased demand of these medications may result in shortages. To mitigate potential shortages, I have concluded that during this peacetime emergency the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy,  established pursuant to Minnesota Statutes 2019, section 151.02, must have authority to exercise appropriate discretion to limit dispensing of these medications
